“Florentijn Hofman: Rubber Duck: Hong Kong 2013” / Crazyisgood Art Installation / SML.20130508.6D.05448

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
I went to check out the giant inflatable duck art installation currently on view at Harbour City to see what the fuss is all about. And there it is, floating on water. 

This gigantic rubber duck which measures 14 x 15 x 16.5 meters was created as a statement for peace. In the Dutch artist Florentijn Hofman’s own words, “the Rubber Duck knows no frontiers, it doesn't discriminate people and doesn't have a political connotation. The friendly, floating Rubber Duck has healing properties: it can relieve mondial tensions as well as define them. The rubber duck is soft, friendly and suitable for all ages!” [1] 

As with all things crazy in Hong Kong, what was most spectacular is not really the duck, but how many it has appeared on the media as well as how many people were seen photographing the duck on the docks. 

On the evening news in Hong Kong, it was reported that some photographers were pushing each other just to get a space to photograph this floating duck. Oh humans.

The best place to photograph this is on the roof of Ocean Terminal where the car park is. There are much less people there and you get to see the duck well. I am claustrophobic so this is obviously where I photographed it.
