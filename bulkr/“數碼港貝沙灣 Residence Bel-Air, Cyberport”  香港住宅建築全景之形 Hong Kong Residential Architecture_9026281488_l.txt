“數碼港貝沙灣 Residence Bel-Air, Cyberport” / 香港住宅建築全景之形 Hong Kong Residential Architecture Panoramic Forms / SML.20130608.6D.15455-SML.20130608.6D.15471-Pano.Spherical.262x95.BW

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Designed by Arquitectonica, the building complexes at 貝沙灣 Residence Bel-Air located at 數碼港 Cyberport feature many of the key ingredients in Hong Kong’s luxury residential properties, as well as some WTF sceneries:

+ “風水洞 Feng Shui Hole”, the hole in the middle of the building which allows the dragon to fly through.
+ High density which soars to the sky. Higher density means more space around for scenery. This allows everyone to have a good view.
+ Ocean view. No one wants to be looking at humans when they are indoors. Well, I don’t.
+ Clothes hanging dry on the balcony. Hong Kong does not have a lot of space so everyone regardless of their income level dry their clothes outside. Truly WTF, yes I know.
+ Swimming pool with a view. This seems almost standard. There is a swimming pool at my place, too. But alas they are always surrounded by buildings so if you are super-private like me you will never swim there. Public swimming pools actually are more private because at least no one can see you.

Pictured is the view from the balcony of one of the apartments at 貝沙灣 Residence Bel-Air. Stitched together using 16 RAW captures with the 6D + 17-40 f/4L, processed with Autopano Giga 3.0 and Lightroom 4.
