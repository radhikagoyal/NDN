“Ichwan Noor (b. 1963): Beetle Sphere, 2013 (Aluminium, polyester, real parts from VW beetle '53, paint)” / Art:1 by Mondecor Gallery / Art Basel Hong Kong 2013 / SML.20130523.6D.14135 — Explored

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Volkswagen has been trending for a while in the social media sphere in recent years. Their retro vans and beetles have been remixed to unrecognisable magical form. So to see this at Art Basel is a surprise. The higher echelon of the art world often feel somewhat dated, filled with “old people” hiding behind the gates in their ivory towers. It is unclear if this means that they are rebranding, or perhaps simply that Asia is the “new world” in art as California is in the world of wines.

This work is by Indonesian artist Ichwan Noor (b. 1963), an artist born in Jakarta and studied at the Indonesian Art Institute, Yogyakarta. He got his idea of this piece from his personal perception that objects are products of a “transportation culture,” which induced hints and signs of spiritual emotion.

For this sculpture / installation, real parts from VW Beetle '53 is used as raw materials, and combined with aluminium and polyester to form this majestic sphere measuring 180 x 180 x 180 cm. Exposure to Indonesian contemporary artworks is a first for me at Art Basel Hong Kong, and I am seriously considering traveling to Indonesia for more.

Seriously. Crazyisgood. SML Love. VW lovers rejoice!
