Sculpture by 牟柏岩 Mu Boyan (b. 1976 China): Dot (Fatty series), 2013 (Color on Stainless steel) / Aye Gallery / Art Basel Hong Kong 2013 / SML.20130523.6D.14253

|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
Whereas having a chiseled body may be a physical ideal in the modern times, being fat was once considered a natural beauty in China. As early as Han Dynasty, the rounded figures used to be desired. And in the early to mid 1900s, when wars were fought across the nation, being fat was once considered a sign of being “well fed,” even though this notion has slowly dissipated.

The “Fatty” sculptural series by Chinese artist 牟柏岩 Mu Boyan (b. 1976) depicts a naked male figure in unimaginable position. Here he is seen hanging onto a ledge and would not let go. Some art critics see the figure as that of sumo wrestler, though I highly doubt that at Chinese artist would be referencing sports culture from Japan.

Similar to the laughing men of 岳敏君 Yue Minjun, you either love it or hate it, but the one thing you cannot do is forget about it. And in that sense it is a successful piece.

Truly demented. Crazyisgood. Just the kind of art I love.
