|  DESCRIPTION  |
+---------------+
At first I thought that this work was by Tony Oursler, who is the only artist I like who integrates videos in his work with other media. But it would appear that I have found someone I should keep an eye on—in China no less.

周啸虎 Zhou Xiaohu (b. 1960, Changzhou, Jiangsu Province) was one the of the first contemporary artists in China to work experimentally with sculptural ideas of video and animation. With a background in sculpture, oil painting and graphic design, Zhou’s work is a dynamic combination of these mediums, reflecting a world in which technology rules and the media is the pinnacle of propaganda and public influence. 

Titled “America Loves Me”, this oil painting on aluminium plate comes come with an animated video as part of the piece which runs for 1 min 6 sec. It shows almost the same image as the painting, except that the shovel was seen digging dirt out from the tent.

As with the best contemporary artworks which I like, I found myself saying “WTF” out loud continuously for almost a minute. I have no idea what it is intended to say. Some day I would love to meet this guy. For now, my tiny brain is off to a reboot.
